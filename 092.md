## Summary

Fee on transfer tokens transfer less tokens in than what would be expect. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This means that the protocol request incorrect amounts when dealing with these tokens,
here in the claimTokens() function.

## Impact

User can't claim full amount of tokens

The protocol should use stored token balances instead of transfer for calculating amounts.
