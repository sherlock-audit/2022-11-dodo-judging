# Usage of deprecated transfer() can result in revert

## Summary

Several functions in `DODORouteProxy` contract will revert if the `eth` is sent to a contract which uses more than 2300 gas to receive it.

## Vulnerability Detail

`transfer()` uses a fixed amount of gas (2300 gas to be exact), which was used to prevent reentrancy. However this limits your protocol to interact with other's contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.

Specifically the `transfer()` function will fail if:

 1. The the receiver's smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function.
 2. The receiver's smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units.
 3. The receiver's smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.

## Impact

All the functions which are using transfer to send `eth` can fail. The instances of this are:
1. [superWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo/blob/main/contracts/SmartRoute/DODORouteProxy.sol#L152)
2. [_routeWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo/blob/main/contracts/SmartRoute/DODORouteProxy.sol#L489) internal function which is used by the following methods:
   a. [externalSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo/blob/main/contracts/SmartRoute/DODORouteProxy.sol#226)
   b. [mixSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo/blob/main/contracts/SmartRoute/DODORouteProxy.sol#308)
   c. [dodoMutliSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo/blob/main/contracts/SmartRoute/DODORouteProxy.sol#374)
 3. [universalTransfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo/blob/main/contracts/SmartRoute/lib/UniversalERC20.sol#L29) which is used by [_routeWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo/blob/main/contracts/SmartRoute/DODORouteProxy.sol#L465) internal function.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// superWithdraw function (Line 152)
payable(routeFeeReceiver).transfer(restAmount);  

// _routeWithdraw function (Line 489)
payable(msg.sender).transfer(receiveAmount);

```

## Tool used

VS code, Manual analysis

## Recommendation

Use `call` instead of `transfer()`. 


```solidity
payable(msg.sender).transfer(receiveAmount);
// can be changed to:
(bool succeeded, ) = msg.sender.call{value: receiveAmount}("");
require(succeeded, "Transfer failed.");
```
