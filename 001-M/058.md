# [NAZ-M2] Usage of deprecated `transfer()` can result in revert.

## Summary
The function `_transferFees()` is used by the accross several functions to transfer ETH/WETH. `transfer()` uses a fixed amount of gas, which was used to prevent reentrancy. However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
These will inevitably fail when: 
1. The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function.
2. The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than `2_300` gas units. 
3. The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than `2_300` gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above `2_300`.

## Impact
`transfer()` uses a fixed amount of gas, which can result in revert. https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call instead of `transfer()`. Example: `(bool succeeded, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}(""); require(succeeded, "Transfer failed.");`
