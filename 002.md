# Use `call()` instead of `transfer()` when transferring eth

## Summary
The `_routeWithdraw` function uses the `transfer()` method when transfering ether instead of `call`

## Vulnerability Detail
`transfer()` method only allows the recipient to use 2300 gas. Transfer will fail if ever the recipient uses more than that gas. Use `call()` instead of `transfer()` when transferring eth. However, keep in mind to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern to reduce the risk of reentrancy when using `call()` function.

## Impact
`transfer()` will fail if ever the recipient uses more 2300  gas.

Vim and Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend using `call()` method instead of `transfer()` when transferring ETH.
```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: receiveAmount}("");
require(success, "Transfer Failed");
```
