# Check return value of sellQuote and sellBase

## Summary

In the _multiSwap function, the return value of sellQuote and sellBase is not checked to be ensure that transaction execution is successfully completed.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the DODO [documentation](https://dodoex.github.io/docs/docs/contractUseGuide/), It is mentioned that `Before the end, traders are advised to check the value of receiveBaseAmount to ensure the safe execution of the transaction.` However this is not checked in the multiSwap function.

## Impact

The received amount can be lost due to slippage.

```solidity
                if (curPoolInfo.direction == 0) {
                    IDODOAdapter(curPoolInfo.adapter).sellBase(
                        assetFrom[i],
                        curPoolInfo.pool,
                        curPoolInfo.moreInfo
                    );
                } else {
                    IDODOAdapter(curPoolInfo.adapter).sellQuote(
                        assetFrom[i],
                        curPoolInfo.pool,
                        curPoolInfo.moreInfo
                    );
                }
            }
```

## Recommendation

Check return value of the following functions.

```solidity
 function sellBase(
   address to
 ) external returns (uint256 receiveQuoteAmount);
```

```solidity
 function sellQuote(
   address to
 ) external returns (uint256 receiveBaseAmount);
