# Literals with many digits is recommanded using Ether suffix

## Summary
routeFeeRate = 1500000000000000 in DODORouteProxy.slitherConstructorVariables() is better to be rewriten using Ether suffix.

## Vulnerability Detail
routeFeeRate = 1500000000000000 is with many digits, and difficult to read and review.  For example, uint 1_ether = 10000000000000000000 looks like 1 ether, but actually it is 10 ether.
