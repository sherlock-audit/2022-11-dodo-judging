# Usage of transfer() may revert.

## Summary
transfer() uses a fixed amount of gas, which was used to prevent reentrancy. However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when: 

1.The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function. 
2.The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units. 
3.The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.
## Impact
transfer() uses a fixed amount of gas, which can result in revert.
