# when `direction=1`   the direction on  pools could be wrong

## Summary
since we are changing `direction=1` when we change the value it will only `sellBase()`  not `sellQuote`.
So if `direction=1` then In the first iteration of the loop it's going to sell  quote tokens   but after that it's going to sell Base tokens  which I don't think it intended
## Vulnerability Detail
when a user calls `mixSwap` function and sets `directions =1` in the first iteration of the loop `directions` gets changed to zero and once it's set to zero `sellBase` function is always called.
## Impact
It can cause loss of funds in the most extreme cases but I don't think   intended and can make a user swap lost funds because they didn't sell quote tokens.
In the comments, it says this 
```solidity 
/// @param directions pool directions aggregation, one bit represents one pool direction, 0 means sellBase, 1 means sellQuote
```
which is not true  because 1  in the loop with bit shifting will be different.
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
        if (directions & 1 == 0) {
                IDODOAdapter(mixAdapters[i]).sellBase(
                    assetTo[i + 1],
                    mixPairs[i],
                    moreInfos[i]
                );
            } else {
                IDODOAdapter(mixAdapters[i]).sellQuote(
                    assetTo[i + 1],
                    mixPairs[i],
                    moreInfos[i]
            }
            directions = directions >> 1;
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
maybe make some sort of offset every  iteration of the loop to make `sellQuote` and `sellBase` functions switch off or have an extra pram like:
```solidity 
pseudocode:
directions=5 then the sell base is always called
directions=2 then the sell quote is always called 
```
Or just have in the  UI  the calculation for bigger numbers what would happen in the loop and tell the user instead of letting random input which can cause loss of funds.
