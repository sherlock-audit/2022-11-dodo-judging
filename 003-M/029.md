# fee can be escaped with reentrancy.

## Summary

Comparing the before and after balance of the swap call for the swapped amount can be exploited to escape the fee by wrapping the actual swap inside a fake swap.

## Vulnerability Detail

The attacker can reenter with another externalSwap -> swapTarget.call to avoid the fee.

1. Swap minAmount with 1inch, inside the 1inch swap, reenter the externalSwap.
2. the inner swap is the actual amount: $1M, which should pay for fee 
3. After the inner swap, amountReceived includes the fee, which will be sent back to the user

As a result, the user successfully escaped most of the fee.

## Impact

User can not pay the fee.
