# Use of `transfer` function to send fund may not work and fund can stuck.

## Summary
The dodo contract system rely on the transfer functionality to send fund in some of the places.

This is well know issue that use of transfer function will fail due to some reasons. Refer the vulnerlability section.

## Vulnerability Detail
transfer functions is used to send the ETH to user. This might fail mostly when the receiver is contract address.

The use of the deprecated transfer() function will inevitably make the call to execute() fail when:

The receiver smart contract implements a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
The receiver smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
Moreover, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

Thus, when receiving the fund, users will be limited to using an EOA or smart contracts with low gas consumption when receiving ETH.

## Impact

Fund transfer will fail and can struck in contract.
