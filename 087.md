# Incompatibility With Rebasing/Deflationary/Inflationary tokens

## Summary

The protocol do not appear to support rebasing/deflationary/inflationary tokens whose balance changes during transfers or over time. The necessary checks include at least verifying the amount of tokens transferred to contracts before and after the actual transfer to infer any fees/interest.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol do not appear to support rebasing/deflationary/inflationary tokens whose balance changes during transfers or over time. The necessary checks include at least verifying the amount of tokens transferred to contracts before and after the actual transfer to infer any fees/interest.

Suppose 100 USDT is transferred via safeTransferFrom() to the TimeLockPool contract.
And a fee is applied (currently 0, but might be changed in the future).
Then you might receive 99.99 USDT
Now you try to do _mint(_receiver, mintAmount); ( 100 USDT ), minting amount will be less than excepted.

## Impact

The internal accounting system of the liquidity would be inaccurate or break, affecting the protocol operation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Determine the transferred amount by subtracting the before & after balance. Have a procedure to don't allow the use of rebasing/inflation/deflation underlying tokens.
