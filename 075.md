# DODOApproveProxy.sol : "function init" can be called by anyone and can take the ownership

## Summary
In `DODOApproveProxy.sol`, the function `init` is used to set the owner and allow the proxy address for setting `_IS_ALLOWED_PROXY_[proxies[i]] = true;.` Since this function is declared as external, anyone can call this and take ownership.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function init(address owner, address[] memory proxies) external {
        initOwner(owner);
        for(uint i = 0; i < proxies.length; i++) 
            _IS_ALLOWED_PROXY_[proxies[i]] = true;
    }

The `init` function is declared as external, anyone can call and take the ownership.

## Impact
The malicious user can influence all the owner dependent functions.

The functions that are controlled by owner are,

This can cause issue in multiple ways. even the contract can be completely blocked or self destructed.
The user can unilaterally change any of the core functionality. 
They can implement their custom token contract and use it to siphon the funds from dodo.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call the `initOwner` function inside the constructor as shown below. so that ownership can be decided during deployment.

    constructor(address dodoApporve, address owner) public {
         initOwner(owner);
        _DODO_APPROVE_ = dodoApporve;
    }

and then, add the `onlyOwner` modifier for calling the `init` function.
    ```function init(address owner, address[] memory proxies) external onlyOwner {
        initOwner(owner);
        for(uint i = 0; i < proxies.length; i++) 
            _IS_ALLOWED_PROXY_[proxies[i]] = true;
    }```
