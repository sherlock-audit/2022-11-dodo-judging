# [NAZ-M1] External Calls Inside Unbounded Loops That May Address DoS

## Summary
There are some unbounded loops with no maximum size and there are multiple external calls being done in said loop that can lead to DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail
Calls to external contracts inside a loop are dangerous (especially if the loop index can be user-controlled) because it could lead to DoS if one of the calls reverts or execution exceeds the block size gas limit. [Reference](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-113)

## Impact
There are over thousands of pools that the loop has to go through, half way through the execution fails due to exceeding the block size gas limit.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider avoiding all the actions executed in a single transaction, especially when calls are executed as part of a loop.
