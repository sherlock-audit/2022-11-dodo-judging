# [Tomo-H1] Can withdraw all funds in the DODORouteProxy contract

## Summary

Can withdraw all funds in the DODORouteProxy contract

## Vulnerability Detail
If the following conditions are passed in `dodoMultiSwap()`, the transaction will succeed.


1. `minReturnAmount` > 0 in `dodoMultiSwap()`
2. `assetFrom.length == splitNumber.length` in `dodoMultiSwap()`
3. The balance of `toToken` in this contract is greater than before executing `multiSwap()` in `dodoMultiSwap()`
4. `receiveAmount >= minReturnAmount` in `_routeWithdraw()`

### Example
Assume the balance of WETH = 10*8*18 USDC, WBTC = 10*10*8

1. Eve executes the `dodoMultiSwap()` as the following parameters contain
`midToken = [ETH, WBTC, ETH]`,`minReturnAmount = 1`, `assetFrom = [address(this), address(this),address(this)]`
2. Assume the value of `toTokenOriginBalance` is 10*8*18 USDC
3. Eve deposits 1 wei USDC by using  `_deposit()` to the DODORouteProxy contract
4. As you can see, there are no check in the `multiSwap()` parameters.
5. Also, the only state variables used in this function are `curTotalAmount` and `totalWeight`. Other values depend on user input.
6. Users can set the values as follows by using `abi.decode()`
- `curPoolInfo.direction` = 0
- `curPoolInfo.poolEdition` = 1
- `curPoolInfo.weight` = 100
- `curPoolInfo.adapter` = address(EveAdapter)

The EveAdapter contract is like this.

7. And then, the all WBTC token in this contract transfer to `curPoolInfo.adapter` like this.
```solidity
// L49
uint256 public totalWeight = 100;

function _multiSwap(/* ... */) internal {
		/* ... */
		uint256 curTotalAmount = IERC20(midToken[i]).tokenBalanceOf(assetFrom[i - 1]);
		uint256 curTotalWeight = totalWeight;
		if (assetFrom[i - 1] == address(this)) {
		  uint256 curAmount = curTotalAmount * curPoolInfo.weight / curTotalWeight ;
                 /// curTotalAmount = 10*10*8,  curPoolInfo.weight = 100, curTotalWeight 100  
		  if (curPoolInfo.poolEdition == 1) {
		      //For using transferFrom pool (like dodoV1, Curve), pool call transferFrom function to get tokens from adapter
		      IERC20(midToken[i]).transfer(curPoolInfo.adapter, curAmount);
		/* ... */
	}
}
```

8. And Eve deposits 1 wei USDC by using  `_multiSwap()`  to the DODORouteProxy contract
9. Next, Eve can pass this checking.

```solidity
require(receiveAmount >= minReturnAmount, "DODORouteProxy: Return amount is not enough");
/// receiveAmount = 2, minReturnAmount = 1
```

10. Finally, Eve gets all WBTC in this contract using 2 wei USDC

## Impact

All tokens in this contract can transfer by small amount tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the balance of tokens used in `assetFrom[]` to see if they have been improperly transferred.

Also, creating whitelisted to restrict the `curPoolInfo.adapter` and `curPoolInfo.pool`
